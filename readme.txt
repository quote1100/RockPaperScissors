Rock Paper Scissors simulator.

According to a research, there are certain psychological tendencies when it comes to rock paper scissors.
If the person wins with their choice, they are likely to stay with their choice.
If the person draws or loses, they then will try to go in order of rock-paper-scissors, 
meaning, if the person lost with rock, then he (or she) is likely  to go with paper, if if lost with paper then scissors and so forth.
This project aims to incoorporate this tactics and see if it is indeed more likely to win if following this pattern.

In easy mode, the AI will select their choice in purely random manner.
In hard mode, the AI will select follow the pattern explained above 50% of the time. For example, if the first round resulted in win with rock, 
the AI will select paper 50% of the time. If the AI lost with rock, then AI will select scissors  50% of the times.

This is still beta. Ultimate goal of the project is to have it posted on a server, have people play, then collect the data to see its consistency with the theory.
percentage of AI's tendency can be changed easily. Perhaps another "difficulty" can be implemented with different probabilities.
